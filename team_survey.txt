3) Feedback:

We really enjoyed working with BigQuery AI during this hackathon.
It simplified querying large datasets and made integrating AI models within SQL very intuitive.
The ability to generate insights directly from BigQuery without exporting data was a big advantage.
Some challenges we faced included setting up permissions correctly like IAM and understanding the nuances of embeddings and ML functions inside BigQuery. However, the documentation and github examples helped us overcome these hurdles.
Overall, the experience was very positive, and we see BigQuery AI as a powerful tool for real-world data analysis and AI-driven applications.
